# What is the purpose of this application?

* Evaluate which marketing media channels will provide the highest revenue with additional funding.
* Understand how to improve business performance with the same level of marketing company funding.
* Plan a media marketing budget to achieve brand business goals.

# Terms and Definitions

* **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)** is an analytical tool that allows to assess the contribution of each element of the marketing mix to the total sales volume and determine the optimal budget for marketing campaigns.

* **Return on Marketing Investment (MROI)**, on the other hand, is a metric used to measure the effectiveness of investments in marketing campaigns.

* **Granularity** in data analysis refers to the level of detail or breakdown of data into smaller parts. This may refer to time intervals, geographic regions, product or service categories, etc.

In the ðŸ“ˆ **MROI Optimizer App**, we use the following granularity levels of marketing campaigns:

1. **Dealership** â€” who provides the data: marketing research agency, social media analytics, etc.

2. **Channel**: TV, out of home, social, GoogleAds.

3. **Format**: traditional, video, display, etc.

4. **Product**: specific product advertising campaign, product subcategories or brand.

* **Contribution** is the part of sales volume provided by a particular marketing activity. Contribution is calculated using the MMM.

* **Saturation curves** visualize the relationship between marketing activity expenditures and contribution or revenue from that activity.
Parameters for building saturation curves were also derived from the MMM results.

# Application Sections

## Specification
In the **"Specification"** section, you can view the results of MMM modeling in graphical and tabular representations and set the granularity level for planning.

Above the table are macro indicators for the selected granularity level.

## Planning

The **"Planning"** section allows you to plan the budget size and allocation based on historical data and MMM results.

The first scenario is **"What if?"** What if you plan to increase or decrease media marketing investments next year?
Enter a new budget and track how macro indicators change.
The modeling takes into account the proportions of budget distribution that were in historical data, as well as the effect of diminishing marginal utility.

Often existing budget allocation is not optimal.
To address this problem, two other planning scenarios are proposed: **spend based optimization** and **goal based optimization**.
The expense optimization scenario allows to maximize the expected return on investment while satisfying budget constraints.
The goal optimization scenario allows to achieve the desired business goals while minimizing the budget.
